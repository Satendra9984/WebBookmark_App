# Problem statement-  
Quite often, we were not able to play high storage games due to the overload of necessary apps .
Also, nowadays we have a lot of websites to use but using browser is a two step process and for easy login we have to give them our password information .

So we decided to utilize the web versions of those apps so that our work can easily be done . So we decided to make an app that stores your passwords along with the link to the webApps .
